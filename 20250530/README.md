# 1. why creating model and how app will work ( manny )?

    - admin can create posts
    - users can comment or like
    - need to create likes doc for reference.
    - mongo doc maximum size - 16mb

## 2. event listeners - update when somethign changes.

    - onSnapshot used as get request after any changes
    - improve by querying the onSnapshot and don't filter in client
